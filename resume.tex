\section{\faWrench\ Projects}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{U of M Blue Bus Time Checker } \small{Python / pyQuery / AWS} }{Feb. 2019}
A Makeathon event project sponsored by Amazon co-developed under 24 hours
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developed a fully-deployable / demo-able Alexa skill that informs user the time of the next bus the user can catch and the time to walk to the closest bus station utilizing Google Matrix APIs
	\item Utilized a python library \href{https://github.com/aws/chalice}{\underline{Chalice}} to develop a backend API that can be accessed in the frontend python script and can be easily deployed to AWS Lambda
	\item Provided data by writing a simple crawler that utilizes requests / pyQuery / BS4 to access the bus time
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented a thread library utilizing linux system infrastructures including ucontext.h that supports multithreading across multiple simulated CPU cores
	\item Provided full multithreading support for library interfaces such as and mutex/condition queue
	\item Implemented a disk scheduler program that reads a series of input representing the track number of disk requests that will be executed synchronously by a disk servicer
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Movie Archive Tracker }  \small{C++} }{Sept. 2018 -- Oct. 2018}
\begin{itemize}
